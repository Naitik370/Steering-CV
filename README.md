# Steering Control with Color Detection

This project implements a steering control mechanism using color detection via a webcam. It includes three Python scripts:

- `steering.py`: Controls the steering based on color detection.
- `color.py`: Detects and isolates specific colors using a trackbar interface.
- `directkeys.py`: Provides functions for simulating key presses.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- OpenCV
- imutils

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/steering-control.git
```

## Usage
- Use the values you get from color.py by isolating the two labels and put it in the steering.py in colourLower variable
